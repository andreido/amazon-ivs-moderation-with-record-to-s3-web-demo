# Amazon IVS Moderation demo â€“ Frontend

### Connecting IVS Channels to the moderation workflow

The moderation workflow is triggered as thumbnail images are written to the S3 bucket created by the backend deployment. The S3 bucket name is returned by the cdk deploy command, or can be retrieved from the resultant outputs.json file or from the AWS Console by viewing the ivs-moderation stack outputs in AWS CloudFormation. 

Amazon IVS automatically creates thumbnail images for channels configured to archive to S3. To add auto-recording to S3 to your IVS Channel:

1. Create a recording configuration and specify the S3 bucket deployed by the backend.
2. The frequency at which images are processed for moderation is controlled by _Target thumbnail interval_.
3. In the IVS Channel configuration page, enable Auto-record to S3 and select the recording configuration.

Refer to the [Create a Channel with Optional Recording](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-channel.html) documentation for additional information
